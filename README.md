                 Scrimpy way to scaffold an assembly using ion torrent reads.

# Overview

ionPairer is a library for scaffolding assemblies somewhat manually using IonTorrent mate pair reads.

A typical workflow would be to start with an assembly generated from single-ended or paired-end (insert size ~300),
and mate pair data generated through ionTorrent. The original data files are not necessary

# Installation

It's a bit complicated. You need several things:

* Perl
* Ruby
* GraphViz
* Perl dependencies
* Ruby dependencies

The few Ruby depencies can be installed by changing directory to the base directory
of ionPairer and running

```sh
$ bundle install
```
    
Note: those people at ACE need only ```module load ionPairer```. 

# Example usage

## First map mate pair reads against the assembly

Take your existing assembly (or binned contigs from a metagenome), then
run ```bwa-sw``` twice (once for each of the forward and reverse reads) to map your
ion MP reads against your contigs. e.g.

```sh
$ bwa index my_assembly.fna    #to create database for bwasw to search against
$ bwa bwasw my_assembly.fna forward_mates.fna >forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam
$ bwa bwasw my_assembly.fna reverse_mates.fna >reverse_matesVmy_assembly.sam
```

## Then run ionPairer:
```sh
$ ionPairer.pl -sam1 forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam -sam2 reverse_matesVmy_assembly.sam -w ion_pairer_outputs
```

In that output directory ```ion_pairer_outputs``` there should be the following files:

* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unpaired.csv``` Reads where only one end mapped to a contig
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.pcr_duplicates.csv``` Reads removed from further analysis as they were judged to be PCR duplicates
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.paired.csv``` Reads where both ends mapped onto one contig
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.error_paired.csv``` Reads where both ends mapped, but erroneously due to insert size or relative orientation
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.csv``` All pairs of mate pairs that span between two contigs and pass the pcr duplicates filter  
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.short_links.csv``` Pairs where one of the contigs was shorter than the insert size
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.error_links.csv``` Pairs which link two contigs, but erroneously due to insert size, position or relative orientation (these may indicate chimeras in the contigs)
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.filtered_links.csv``` Subset of unique pairs which are neither short nor erroneous

There'll also be three graphviz-related files:

* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.gv``` The dot file (GraphViz file) used to specify the links between contigs
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.png``` A png picture representation of the dot file. The colours are meaningful. Specifically red contigs are longer than 2x 
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.svg``` An svg picture representation of the dot file

## The next step is manual inspection of the scaffolds. 
The fun bit! In 
```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.png``` (or the svg file)
is a representation of the links that have been made, and the number of mate-pairs that 
agree with that linking.

To modify the scaffolds, modify the ```gv``` file (maybe best to also copy it to a new file ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.manually_modified.gv```). For instance if this link is no good, for whatever reason:

```
contig00056END -- contig00073START [label="3links", ...
```
Then simply delete the entire line. It may be advisable to save this modified version as a different file so you can use ```diff``` or ```meld``` to work out what has changed between the original and manually curated versions.

Afterwards, rerun graphviz, which will make a new png/svg file for you, like so
```sh
$ neato -Tpng forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.manually_modified.gv >forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.manually_modified.png
```
(or ```-Tsvg``` for svg output.)

## Once you are happy with the manual assembly and want to do the actual scaffolding
Once the ```.gv``` file has been editted to your satisfaction, you have 2 options.

1. Use the ```scaffolder.pl``` script to create the scaffolds. This script will orient the contigs (forward or reverse complement) and scaffold, based on the dot file. There is a small bug though, where single unlinked contigs have to be manually added into the final output ```.scaffolded```.

Example usage:
```sh
$ scaffolder.pl -g edited.gv -f contigs.fna > scaffold_map.fna
```

2. Use the ```dot_to_scaffolder_yaml.rb``` script to convert the dot file to a YAML file, in a particular [format](http://next.gs). This YAML file can be further modified, for example to overlap contig ends. This script is in the tools folder.

Example usage:
```sh
$ mkdir scaffolds
$ dot_to_scaffolder_yaml.rb -g edited.gv -d scaffolds
```

## Joining contigs across unresolved parts
Sometimes if two contigs reside next to each other in a scaffold, then they in reality overlap - there is no Ns between them. The tool ```blast_contig_ends.rb``` automates the process of looking for these using a simple blast-based method (blast+, that is). If the output of this script shows that, indeed, some contigs do overlap, then modify the output from ```dot_to_scaffolder_yaml.rb```, deleting the relevant ```unresolved``` bit and specify where exactly the overlap occurs by using ```start``` and ```stop```. See http://next.gs/man/scaffolder-format/ for more information. When finished use the ```scaffolder``` tool from http://next.gs to generate the final, assembled, fasta file.

Example usage:
```sh
$ blast_contig_ends.rb -d edited.gv -s contigs.fna
 INFO blast_contig_ends: Cached 117 sequences, e.g. contig00001 => CGCTTGGCCT...

Possible overlap on scaffold 3 between contigs contig00097 (start) and contig00035 (start), %ID 92.96, Length 199, 1-199 vs 199-2

(manually modify scaffolds/scaffold3.yml to indicate the overlap)

$ scaffolder sequence scaffolds/scaffold3.yml contigs.fna >scaffolds.scaffold3.fna
```
That last step needs to be repeated for each scaffold (potentially in a bash for loop).
