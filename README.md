       Scrimpy way to scaffold an assembly using ion torrent reads.

# Overview

ionPairer is a library for scaffolding assemblies somewhat manually using IonTorrent mate pair reads.

A typical workflow would be to start with an assembly generated from single-ended or paired-end (insert size ~300),
and mate pair data generated through ionTorrent. The original data files are not necessary

# Installation

It's a bit complicated. You need several things:

* Perl
* Ruby (v1.9.3 tested only)
* GraphViz
* Ruby dependencies

The few Ruby depencies can be installed by changing directory to the base directory
of ionPairer and running

```sh
$ bundle install
```
    
Note: those people at ACE need only ```module load ionPairer```. 

# Example usage

## First map mate pair reads against the assembly

Take your existing assembly (or binned contigs from a metagenome), then
run ```bwa-sw``` twice (once for each of the forward and reverse reads) to map your
ion MP reads against your contigs. e.g.

```sh
$ bwa index my_assembly.fna    #to create database for bwasw to search against
$ bwa bwasw my_assembly.fna forward_mates.fna >forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam
$ bwa bwasw my_assembly.fna reverse_mates.fna >reverse_matesVmy_assembly.sam
```

## Then run ionPairer:
```sh
$ ionPairer.pl -sam1 forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam -sam2 reverse_matesVmy_assembly.sam -w ion_pairer_outputs
```

In that output directory ```ion_pairer_outputs``` there should be the following files:

* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.links.csv``` Reads which link two contigs
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.paired.csv``` Reads where both ends mapped onto one contig
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.lerror.csv``` Reads which link two contigs, but erroneously
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.perror.csv``` Reads where both ends mapped, but erroneously
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unpaired.csv``` Reads where only one end mapped
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.pcr_duplicates.csv``` Reads removed from further analysis as they were judged to be PCR duplicates
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.csv``` All pairs of mate pairs that span between two contigs, after the pcr duplicates have been removed

There'll also be three graphviz-related files:

* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.dot``` the dot file used to specify the links between contigs
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.png``` A png picture representation of the dot file. The colours are meaningful. Specifically red contigs are longer than 2x 
* ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.unique_links.svg``` An svg picture representation of the dot file

## The next step is manual inspection of the scaffolds. 
The fun bit! In 
```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.png``` (or the svg file)
is a representation of the links that have been made, and the number of mate-pairs that 
agree with that linking.

To modify the scaffolds, modify the ```dot``` file (maybe best to also copy it to a new file ```forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.manually_modified.dot```). For instance if this link is no good, for whatever reason:

```
contig00056END -- contig00073START [label="3links", ...
```
Then simply comment it out:
```
#contig00056END -- contig00073START [label="3links", ...
```
and rerun graphviz, which will make a new png/svg file for you, like so
```sh
$ neato -Tpng forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.manually_modified.dot >forward_matesVmy_assembly.sam.all_links.manually_modified.png
```
(or ```-Tsvg``` for svg output.)

## Once you are happy with the manual assembly and want to do the actual scaffolding
Once the ```.dot``` file has been editted to your satisfaction, 
use ```scaffolder.pl``` script to create the scaffolds. This script will orient the contigs (forward or reverse complement) and scaffold 
the contigs with an arbitrary 25 Ns between each contig.
